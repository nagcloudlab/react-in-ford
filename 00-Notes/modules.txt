.js developement , without module standards,

 have 2 problems

-> global naming coliision
-> dependency management

solution: using module standards

-> CommonJS ( cjs )
-> ECMAScript Module ( esm )

CommonJS ( cjs )
-----------------

-> every .js file is a module
-> all variables/functions are private by default
-> to make them public, we need to use module.exports
-> to import them, we need to use require
-> group related modules as package with package.json

imp-note: Node.js uses CommonJS as module standard

ECMAScript Module ( esm )
-------------------------

-> every .js file is a module
-> all variables/functions are private by default
-> to make them public, we need to use export
-> to import them, we need to use import
-> group related modules as package with package.json
